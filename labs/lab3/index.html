		<h3>Goal</h3>
		<p><b>Lab 3: Midterm covering chapters 2-6</b><br>
		In this lab, you will answer three questions. You are expected to provide a graph via jsFiddle that answers each question; thus your query not only has to be correct, but must produce JSON output that can be dropped into javascript code and run directly from jsFiddle. You will want the resulting graph to be sorted (ie, from largest to smallest by some metric) and have enough inherent information to be easily understood.</p>
		<p>You will still be working in the same groups. Group leders will have the responsibility of dividing work among members; some group members will be able to handle more than others - as a group, you are expected to be open and honest about your strengths and weaknesses, and adapt. You will also take notes and report why you made the decisions you did (decisions about anything, the more you elaborate the better).
		</p>

		<h3>Objectives</h3>
		<p><table cellpadding="1">
		 <tr>
		  <td><img src="/~csc191/images/checkbox.png" width="15px" height="15px" style="margin:0 3px 0 0;vertical-align: top;"></td>
		  <td><b>Question 1: Which schools are overchosen?</b><br>
		  Consider which schools have more "votes" than total capacity.
		  </td>
		 </tr>
		 <tr>
		  <td><img src="/~csc191/images/checkbox.png" width="15px" height="15px" style="margin:0 3px 0 0;vertical-align: top;"></td>
		  <td><b>Question 2: By school, how many households received their first choice?</b><br>
		  Answer this question for each school - this is similar to Question 1, but not exactly. You can choose to answer this question with percentages or raw numbers.
		  </td>
		 </tr>
		 <tr>
		  <td><img src="/~csc191/images/checkbox.png" width="15px" height="15px" style="margin:0 3px 0 0;vertical-align: top;"></td>
		  <td><b>Question 3: How many households did not receive any of their top 3 choices?</b><br>
		  There should be a minimum of three rows in the output, one each for 1st choice, 2nd choice and 3rd choice. Most people are assigned their first choice, so the first row should show me a count of everyone who did not receive their first choice. Of that number, some people received their second choice, but some did not. The second row should tell me how many still have not received a choice. The third row should be a subset of the second row. <br>
		  The answer is the third row; however you could continue and show me counts for all choices for a more complete picture.
		  </td>
		 </tr>
		 </table>
		</p>

		<h3>What to have at the end</h3>
		<p>For each question, modify the original <a href="http://jsfiddle.net/sacrophyte/veqfatc8/1/">jsfiddle</a>, click "Update" (which should give you a new jsfiddle URL), and then "Share link" via "Share". Have one member of your group send the link to me, and as a group make sure the link appears in the group Google Doc. Also in the group google doc, make sure you record your observations, comments and justification.
