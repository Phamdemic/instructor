		<h3>Goal</h3>
		<p>At the end of this lesson, you have hands on experience with connecting to a database, creating a table and populating it with data. Even though students are not yet exposed to SQL proper, we are setting the stage for the rest of the semester.
		</p>

		<h3>Objectives</h3>
		<p><table cellpadding="1">
		 <tr>
		  <td><img src="/~csc191/images/checkbox.png" width="15px" height="15px" style="margin:0 3px 0 0;"></td>
		  <td>Choose a database you want to work on for the rest of the semester (mysql, postgres, sqlite). The bulk of the class will be on mysql, but some of you may wish to explore.
		  </td>
		 </tr>
		 <tr>
		  <td><img src="/~csc191/images/checkbox.png" width="15px" height="15px" style="margin:0 3px 0 0;"></td>
		  <td>Create and connect to a database of your choice.
		  </td>
		 </tr>
		 <tr>
		  <td><img src="/~csc191/images/checkbox.png" width="15px" height="15px"></td>
		  <td>Create a table and fill it with data (using examples from class)
		  </td>
		 </tr>
		 <tr>
		  <td><img src="/~csc191/images/checkbox.png" width="15px" height="15px"></td>
		  <td>Communicate to the instructor the following details: the database type, host and name, and the name of the table. If you would like the instructor to look it over, it is suggested that you use a database on onyx.
		  </td>
		 </tr>
		 </table>
		</p>

		<h3>Details</h3>
		<p>Obviously, much of this will be done in class. The difference here is that you are encouraged to get something running on your own computer. You are encouraged to explore, try new things even if they seem "too hard" or totally new to you. For those with a more programming bent, think about how you would connect an application to the database. Sqlite is awesome for embedded systems because it has such a small footprint, mysql has a ton of popular support in the wider community and is widely deployed. Postgres, Oracle, Microsoft SQL Server all have their own benefits - the database is but a tool, and you want the right tool for the job.

		Additionally, if you have not yet looked at <a href="/~csc191/labs/lab1/">lab 1</a> (aka, week 0 "lesson"), I encourage you to do that now; lab 1 is meant to orient the student to the class and install some software that will help manage database connections and write SQL.
