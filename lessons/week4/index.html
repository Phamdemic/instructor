		<h3>Goal</h3>
		<p>Explore the differences between a single "flat" table (aka, denormalized) versus many smaller, related tables (aka, normalized).
		</p>

		<h3>Objectives</h3>
		<p><table cellpadding="1">
		 <tr>
		  <td><img src="/~csc191/images/checkbox.png" width="15px" height="15px" style="margin:0 3px 0 0;"></td>
		  <td><b>A</b>. Run sql scripts to create a few extra tables that copy the data into a hierarchy.
		  </td>
		 </tr>
		 <tr>
		  <td><img src="/~csc191/images/checkbox.png" width="15px" height="15px"></td>
		  <td><b>B</b>. Create a table from Question 1.3 of last <a href="http://onyx.csit.parkland.edu/~csc191/lessons/week3/index.html">week</a>.
		  </td>
		 </tr>
		 <tr>
		  <td><img src="/~csc191/images/checkbox.png" width="15px" height="15px"></td>
		  <td><b>C</b>. Convert all your queries from <a href="http://onyx.csit.parkland.edu/~csc191/lessons/week3/index.html">week 3</a> to work against these new tables, including the two Advanced questions.
		  </td>
		 </tr>
		 <tr>
		  <td><img src="/~csc191/images/checkbox.png" width="15px" height="15px"></td>
		  <td><b>D</b>. Summarize your experience.
		  </td>
		 </tr>
		 </table>
		</p>

		<h3>Details</h3>
		<p><b>A. Run these scripts to create three new tables:</b> <br>
		<b style="color:red">IMPORTANT:</b> If you have not already, create/rename your lottery table to "lottery" and make sure the column names match, or else the rest of this will be a certified mess. *grin* You can use the "BETTER INSTRUCTIONS" from <a href="http://onyx.csit.parkland.edu/~csc191/lessons/week2/">week 2</a> <br>
		- <a href="create_2012_master.sql">create_2012_master.sql</a> <br>
		- <a href="create_tables.sql">create_tables.sql</a> <br>
		- <a href="create_data.sql">create_data.sql</a> <br>
</p>

		<p><b>B. Create a new table for school names</b> <br>
		"Translate the school names from their two-character abbreviation to the full name". Use a sql statement similar to:
		<pre>create table u4_school_names as ( &lt;your query goes here&gt; );</pre>
		Name the first column school_id, the second column school_name (the second one goes after "end" of the CASE statement).
                </p>

		<p><b>C. Rewrite Week 3 queries using new tables</b> <br>
		You will probably want to explore the new tables a little. Do a few "select *" statements to see what they look like, how many rows they have, etc. Also, I have included column comments to better explain what each column does. If you are really observant, you will notice under the "Structure" tab in phpMyAdmin that the Primary Key icon is not gold for some columns. <br> <br>
		Once you are familiar with the tables, rewrite the queries you wrote for section 1 last week using the new tables, including the two Advanced queries. Your results should be the same.
                </p>

		<p><b>D. Summary</b> <br>
		What differences did you observe between week3 and this week? Which one did you prefer to work with? Be sure to include any other thoughts/observations.
		</p>
		<h3>END</h3>
		<p>Consolidate all your work into a single document (word, text doc, email, etc) and email that to me with the subject "CSC 191: Week 4" and your name. It really helps me when you include the question along with the answer. *grin* Due by Sunday at 11:59 pm</p>
