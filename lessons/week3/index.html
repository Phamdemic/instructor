		<h3>Details</h3>
		<p><b>1. Answer these questions with queries</b>
		   <ul>
		    <li>List the assigned school and all school choices for each person, ordered by the assigned school.</li>
		    <li>How many times was each school chosen as a first choice? Order the output by the number of times chosen</li>
		    <li>Translate the school names from their two-character abbreviation to the full name. Use ch1schna, and only list each school once. <a href="http://www.champaignschools.org/pages/elementary-schools">HINT 1</a>; HINT 2: Booker T Washington = BTW = WA</li>
		    <li><b>Advanced</b>: If you were one of the parents that chose Bottenfield as your second choice, what was the chance that you were assigned to Bottenfield? <br>HINT 1: For percentage, use the formula:<pre>100*(times assigned)/(total time chosen) </pre></li>
		    <li><b>Advanced (optional)</b>: If instead you were one of the parents that chose Doctor Howard as your second choice, what was the chance that you were assigned to Howard? Second question/query: Why? (HINT: ch1stat)</li>
		   </ul>
</p>

<p>
<b>2. Explain why these queries do not correctly answer the Advanced question about Bottenfield: <br>
Query 1
</p>
<pre> SELECT 100 * count(asgsch) / count(*) from lottery where ch2schna = 'BO'; </pre>
<br>
<p>
Query 2
</p>
<pre> SELECT 100 * count(case when asgsch = 10 then 1 else 0 end) / count(*) from lottery where ch2schna = 'BO'; </pre>

</p>

		<p><b>3. How to turn boring data into an exciting story</b> <br>
		This is to give you a taste of what the final project is working towards. First, take a peek at some interactive charts; hover over the different areas, click on the items in the legend, etc: <br>
		<a href="http://lottery.cb-pta.com/visualize/">http://lottery.cb-pta.com/visualize/</a>
		</p>

                <p>After you play around a little, consider which columns from the lottery table you would need to populate those charts. You are welcome to come up with queries if you like, but that is not required for this stage. Tell me which columns, which rows, and any sort of aggregation (ie, sum? max?) you would need.
                </p>

		<h3>END</h3>
		<p>Consolidate all your work into a single document (word, text doc, email, etc) and email that to me with the subject "CSC 191: Week 3" and your name. It really helps me when you include the question along with the answer. *grin* Due by Sunday at 11:59 pm</p>
