<h1>CSC 191: Lab 2</h1>

<span style="font-size:125%; font-weight:bold">Covers chapters 2-4 (selects, tables, constraints)</span>
<p>

<span style="font-size:125%; font-weight:bold; font-style:underline">Objective</span>
<br>
Lab 2 explores the concepts covered in the previous chapters by way of a <b><i>role-playing</i></b> example.
The lab is meant to be collaborative; each member should contribute to the success of the group.
It is expected that there will be natural leaders in any given group; be sure to avoid having one group member do all the talking and/or typing. Each group will be working on the same tasks.
Note that most bullet points can be done in parallel, meaning that one member of the group can work on a specific task while other members work on other tasks. But not <i>all</i> tasks can be done in parallel.
As with normal CSC 191 classes, individual participation counts towards your grade.
<p>
[NOTE: it is highly recommended that each group member read this entire lab before touching a keyboard. This is a good habit to get into, especially as the labs get more difficult]

<span style="font-size:125%; font-weight:bold; font-style:underline">Background</span>
<br>
The City commisioners have recently purchased a maximum security facility on the outskirts of town. In addition, it has taken over management of a poorly run juvenile detention operation. The City is asking you to adapt the City Jail database to accomodate these changes and suggest a single table.
<p>
In addition, the circuit clerks have been complaining that there is no way to track if convicted citizens are doing community service as a plea bargain. The City is asking that you create a table to track community service.
<p>
