<b>Chapter 4</b>
<ul>
 <li>Pop Quiz</li>
 <li>Task for students: think of one real-world reason why constraints are important.</li>
 <li>Have each student create a table specific to their example.</li>
</ul>

<br>
<b>UNIQUE KEY</b>
<ul>
 <li> Let's start with Unique constratints. Everyone create a unique key on your table (syntax on pp. 111 and 127). If you do not yet have a field that makes sense to be unique, create a new ID field (ie, your_table_name_ID). Teacher will monitor progress on the main screen so we can see new tables/constraints as they pop up. Teacher will then attempt to insert duplicate data.</li>
 <li>So tell me, what do <b>Unique</b> constraints do?</li>
 <li>This unique key is preventing "bad" data, or redundant rows.</li>
</ul>

<p>
<br>
<b>NOT NULL</b>
<ul>
 <li>What do <b>NOT NULL</b> constraints do?</li>
 <li>Same thing here, students create a NOT NULL constraint for their table (syntax: pp 115, 128). Teacher will then attempt to insert NULL data into constrained rows.
 <li>NOTE: NULL data can be inserted into columns with UNIQUE Constraints.</li>
</ul>

<p>
<br>
<b>CHECK</b></br>
<ul>
 <li>What do <b>CHECK</b> constraints do?
 <li>This one might be a tad trickier. Here we create a "user-defined" constraint. If you have to create a new column for this exercise, please do so. For example, Gender, citizen y/n, active, in class, awake, 18 years or older...
 <li>Next, create the constraint (pp 113, 127-128). Teacher will attempt to violate the constraint with "bad" data.
 <li>So far, each constraint type has only affected a single column in one table. We now move on to a special class of constraints that are truly relational.
</ul>

<p>
<br>
<b>PRIMARY KEY</b><br>
<ul>
 <li>What does a Primary Key actually do? What is it used for? Please do not repeat what the book says on page 103.
 <li>We need something that can isolate one row from all the others, or uniquely identifies it.
 <li>And we have to account for NULL values. The Primary Key is like a Unique Constraint and  NOT NULL Constraint all wrapped up in one. We will start with a simple primary key. But first let us drop whatever Unique Constraints we have.
 <li>How to find the names of constraints? Those who read the book will know that information is on pages 120-122. We can find the constraints we created earlier with something like this:<br>
<pre>select constraint_name, constraint_type from user_constraints where table_name = '&my_table';</pre>
 <li>As you probably know, if you did not name the constraint when you created it, it was given a name by the rdbms, something like 'SYS_%'. Let us drop the constraint of type 'U' for our table (pp 124):
PS - here is a tricky way to generate the code:<br>
<pre>select 'alter table &my_table drop constraint '|| constraint_name ||';' from user_constraints where constraint_type = 'U';</pre>
 <li>And now we can add a primary key constraint on this sucker (pp 103, 126-127). Go fo it.
 <li>So what's the big difference between Unique Keys and Primary keys? They both seem to do the same thing, right?<p>
</ul>

<p>
<br>
<b>FOREIGN KEY</b><br>
<ul>
 <li>Foreign keys require a Primary key. It is entirely possible to put a Foreign key on the same table as the Primary key (and I have seen this done), but that doesn't make any sense. The book does have an example of this on pp 109. Usually, a Foreign key points to the primary key of a <b><i>different</i></b> table.
<pre>create table foreign_table (local_key varchar2(2), remote_key varchar2(2));</pre>
 <li>So we have this new table. Right now it does not have any constraints on it. yet. We could put a primary key on the local_key column. But this exercise is about Foreign keys. We want to put a limitation on this column that depends on a column in a completely different table.
 <li>Go ahead and create a foreign key on this new table to your sample table.
 <li>Some weird things with drop/disable. You can drop and even disable a primary key with the cascade option. But you cannot enable with cascade. That would be so cool! But, alas, the syntax does not allow it. But let's try it anyway.
 <li>If you want to remove rows from a table with a primary key that has a foreign key pointing to it, you have to consider the "referential integrity". Integrity being the key word. :)
 </ul>
