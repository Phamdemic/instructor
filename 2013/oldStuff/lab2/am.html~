<h1>CSC 191: Lab 2: Account Managers</h1>

<span style="font-size:125%; font-weight:bold">Covers chapters 2-5 (selects, constraints, transactions, ddl)</span>
<p>

<span style="font-size:125%; font-weight:bold; font-style:underline">Objective</span>
<br>
Lab 2 explores the concepts covered in the previous chapters by way of a <b><i>role-playing</i></b> example.
Each student will be placed in one of three <a href="http://www.csit.parkland.edu/~cschultz/csc191/chapters/chapter1/role_playing_job_descriptions.html">groups</a>, or <a href="http://www.csit.parkland.edu/~cschultz/csc191/chapters/chapter1/role_playing_job_descriptions.html">roles</a>. Each group has a specific and distinct lists of
tasks to accomplish during this lab. Everybody will log in to the database as user SCOTT.
<p>
The lab is meant to be collaborative; each member should contribute to the success of the group.
It is expected that there will be natural leaders in any given group; be sure to avoid having one group member do all the talking and/or typing.
Note that most bullet points can be done in parallel, meaning that one member of the group can work on a specific task while other members work on other tasks.
As with normal CSC 191 classes, individual participation counts towards your grade.
<p>
[NOTE: it is highly recommended that each group member read this entire lab before touching a keyboard. This is a good habit to get into, especially as the labs get more difficult]

		<li>in a later chapter, we will learn a better, faster way to do this</li>
	</ul>
	<li>select list of current books, sort by profit</li>
	<li>increase price of least profitable book</li>
	<li>select list of current books, sort by profit</li>
</ol>
<p>

<span style="font-size:125%; font-weight:bold; font-style:underline">What to have at the end</span>
<br>
At the end of this lab, each group should have one sql file (aka, script) that executes all the queries necessary to duplicate the tasks identified for the group.
ote that some groups have to communicate with others; this should be done <b><i>before</i></b> the lab ends, with plenty of time for the recipient group to accomplish said tasks.
<p>
<p>

<span style="font-size:125%; font-weight:bold; font-style:underline">PS</span>
<br>
Those that have to communicate with another group may ask "how?". You are adults, figure it out. *grin* Put yourself in the shoes of a real employee. There is no wrong way to transfer information in this regard.
If something is confusing or not readily obvious, I highly recommend you put on your thinking cap and work it out. Talk amongst yourselves, use Google... whoops, maybe that is too much of a hint...
