<h1>CSC 191</h1>
<h2>Final: Lab 5: Create a homework database</h2>

<p>
<b><font size="+2">Objectives</font></b><br>
Students must come up with an ERD, make users and assign roles/privs, create all necessary tables, populate those tables and generate all sql queries that allow student homework to be submitted, graded and viewed.

<p>
<b><font size="+2">Context</font></b><br>
You have been working with "Homework Checker"; this is essentially a php/javascript front-end for a homework database. Your job is to start from scratch and design something similar, using all the knowledge you have learned from this class. You will not be implementing the front-end stuff (php/javascript), but by the end of the class today, you will have a working database that is capable of being used as a backend.

<p>
<b><font size="+2">Grading</font></b><br>
Students will be graded on the following criteria, ranked in order of weight:
<ul>
	<li>participation (60%): talking, volunteering to do work, assembling, managing tasks</li>
	<li>syntax (30%): If you are responsible for a query, make sure it does exactly what it is supposed to do</li>
	<li>progress (10%): Tackle tasks one at a time. It is more important to do a good job on half the lab than a bad job on all of it</li>
</ul>

<p>
<b><font size="+2">Tasks</font></b><br>
<ol>
	<li>Create ERD</li>
	<li>Implement design</li>
	<ol class="la">
		<li>create user accounts with necessary privs, roles</li>
		<ol class="lr">
			<li>Teacher</li>
			<li>TA</li>

		<li>create table(s)</li>
		<li>grant privs to roles</li>
		<li>populate table(s)</li>
	</ol>
	<li>Generate queries for the front-end</li>
	<ol class="la">

<b><font size="+2">To have at the end</font></b><br>
<ul>
	<li>Teacher login/password and role. Able to add/change grades and answer key. Access to a view (report) that summarizes grades.</li>
	<li>TA login/password and role. Able to add/change grades. Can view answer key.</li>
	<li>Student login/password and role(s). Able to submit homework and see submissions via a view</li>
	<li>For the above, sample queries are to be provided that demonstrate what the login can do. Add queries to collaborative spreadsheet like Lab 4 - the buttons will be the proof of work</li>
	<li>All queries must return data in under 2 seconds</li>
	<li>ADVANCED: Report that generates a bell curve</li>
</ul>
